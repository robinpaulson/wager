Wager is an app for Android, iOS and desktop.

It is designed so you may track the numerical parts of your paid employment, including:
* Pay
* Income tax & other deductions
* Annual leave
* Sick leave

The intention is for you to enter a few details about your employment including:
* Hourly rate
* Country
* Employer name
* Tax number
* Work schedule

Upon doing so, it will produce tables of the important information about you and your job. This information can then be used to keep track of your pay and other work information, to understand if and how much your employer is not being honest and as evidence in an employment dispute, including going to court.

It is currently in pre-alpha state, not suitable for anyone to use except for testing.
