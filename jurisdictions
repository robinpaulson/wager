For Wager to be useful in a particular location, we are required to translate the local tax code and employment law into a format which Wager can understand. The developers are based in New Zealand, so that jurisdiction will be the first we translate. If you would like to assist translating the tax code for your jurisdiction, please read CONTRIBUTING.md.
