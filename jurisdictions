For Wager to be useful in a particular location, we are required to translate the local tax code and employment law into a format which Wager can understand. The developers are based in New Zealand, so that jurisdiction will be the first we translate. If you would like to assist translating the tax code for your jurisdiction, please read CONTRIBUTING.md.

Alternatively, if you wish to produce data for your own jurisdiction, you may do so. You are not permitted to modify the code for the app, but we consider the code for the employment law as a separate piece of software; if you wish to use it with Wager, you must release it under a version of the GNU GPL or GNU Affero GPL. Currently we do not have a repository to store the code for employment jurisdictions, but this will be put together in the future.
