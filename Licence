Preamble
========
Most free software and open source licences produce a "wild west", a sprawling mess of an ecosystem which favours the so-called "tech bros", macho white men who engage in masculine behaviours we consider at best unhelpful, often destructive and always an impediment to good relationships and the development of good software.

As such, we restrict who may submit code modifications or take part in discussions. All participants must be vetted before they may do so.

We do however allow anyone to view the code, to understand what it might do to their system and information. However, not allow forking or development beyond that which is permitted and directed by the steering committee.

The licence
===========
You may view, study, review and comment upon the source code
You may compile the source code, for any hardware or operating system
You may modify the code, but not distribute that modified code unless you are a member of the developer group, or to other members of the development group (for the sole purpose of demonstrating your proficiency to the steering committee)
You may redistribute the original source code, so long as this licence remains with the code; all conditions are also transferred

no warranty
===========
No warranty is implied for fitness of purpose
