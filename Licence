Preamble
========
Most free software and open source licences produce a "wild west", a sprawling mess of an ecosystem which favours the so-called "tech bros", macho white men who engage in masculine behaviours we consider at best unhelpful, often destructive and always an impediment to good relationships and the development of good software.

As such, we restrict who may submit code modifications or take part in discussions. All participants must be vetted before they may do so.

We do however allow anyone to view the code, to understand what it might do to their system and information. We do not allow forking or development beyond that which is permitted and directed by the steering committee.

All code is Copyright The Wager Project. Contributors (where they permit reproduction of their names) are noted in the contributions.md file

The licence
===========
You may view, study, review and comment upon the source code
You may compile the source code, for any hardware or operating system
You may not modify the code, unless permitted to do so by the steering committee
?? You may not link to the code, except for the purpose of developing scripts for employment law jurisdictions
You may redistribute the original source code, so long as this licence remains with the code; all conditions are also transferred

No warranty
===========
No warranty or fitness for purpose is implied.
