As stated in the Licence, there are problems with the majority of free software/open source projects currently in existence. They are primarily created, coded and steered by hetero-normative, cis-gendered, able-bodied, white men aged between 18 and 50. The default atmosphere is one of competition, machismo and bravado. All other voices are ritually disparaged and marginalised, any non-libertarian politics ignored.

We do not wish for Wager to be developed like this. As such, we have set up a steering committee which is dominated by non-male/disabled/LGBITQA+/people of colour. This committee makes all major decisions about the direction of the software, who may take part in coding and anything else related to the software and the community around it.

If you wish to contribute to the code, the documentation or any other aspect of Wager, please contact the steering committee, via one of the following methods:
