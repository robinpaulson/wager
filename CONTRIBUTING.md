As stated in the Licence, there are problems with the majority of free software/open source projects currently in existence. The majority are primarily created, coded and steered by hetero-normative, cis-gendered, able-bodied white men between 18 and 50. The default atmosphere is one of competition, machismo and bravado.

We do not wish for Wager to be developed like this. As such, we have a steering committee which is dominated by non-male/disabled/LGBITQA+/people of colour.

If you wish to contribute to the code, the documentation or any other aspect of Wager, please contact the steering committee, via one of the following methods:
