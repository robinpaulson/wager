As stated in the Licence, there are problems with the majority of free software/open source projects currently in existence. They are primarily created, maintained and steered by unimaginative hetero-normative, cis-gendered, able-bodied, middle-class, technically-educated white men with one eye always on fiscal (if not social) conservativism. The default atmosphere is one of competition, machismo and bravado. All other voices are ritually disparaged and marginalised, any non-libertarian politics ignored.

We do not wish for Wager to be developed in this way. As such, we have set up a steering committee which is dominated by non-male/disabled/LGBITQA+/people of colour/indigenous people. This committee makes all major decisions about the direction of the project, who may take part in it and anything else related to the project and the community around it. All those involved in coding, documentation writing, community liaison and any representation of the project, for instance to unions, are expected to take direction from the steering committee in all matters.

If you wish to contribute to the project in any way, please contact the steering committee, via one of the following methods:
email: robin@bumblepuppy.org
telephone: (+64) ??? ??? ????

We are interested in hearing from those who have the following skills and experience:
* Outreach to workers and unions
* Activism in labour law and conditions
* Employment law
* Accountancy
* Human resources
* Development for Android and iPhone, particularly using React-Native and SQL
* Documentation of react-native code
* Graphic design of logos, etc.
* Development of user interfaces
* Applying for grants and other income from charitable foundations, councils, etc.

* We would also like to hear from anyone who wishes to contribute as a member of the steering committee; experience of poorly-paid, precarious employment in poor conditions is essential

For all positions, we will actively promote the selection of non-white men, particularly the steering committee

Currently we cannot offer payment for any work; once we have demonstrated Wager is a useful, positive tool for employees, we will be applying for grants to enable the payment of staff.

If you are not able or willing to actively join in with developing or promoting the project, we welcome donations to our charity.

Once Wager is in a reliable state, we ask anyone who is interested to try it out and recommend it to colleagues, friends, family and your union.
