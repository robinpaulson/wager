We currently develop using a combination of expo and react-native-desktop.

These enable live reloading of code and automated builds which mean we have a
very fast turnaround between writing and seeing the effects of what we write.

See the respective documents for details on how to set up the environments.

At the moment, we do not provide information or support for developing Wager on
Windows, macOS or any other non-Linux-based desktop operating system. You can
probably put together a system for this, although it may take more effort to
maintain and use.
