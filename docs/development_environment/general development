For whichever environment you are using, the following are essential:
git and node

It is possible to develop using any operating system, including Windows,
although we recommend a Unix-like OS; any  BSD- or Linux-based system should be
fine, including macOS. Our preference is for Ubuntu and Debian.

The version of git supplied with your desktop BSD- or Linux-based operating
system is fine, although later versions may be faster.

Node may also be installed from your OS repositories, but it will certainly be
relatively old and not include the important supplementary tools including npm.

We recommend using nvm (node version manager) to install node, npm and other
node-related tools. It can be installed from here:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

You will probably want the latest version of both node and npm, although some
node scripts (react-native is based upon node) apparently do not work in the
latest version, 12. For the moment, we are using whichever is the latest minor
version of node 11.

As an alternative to npm, yarn is increasingly popular, does an almost identical
job and appears to be faster, although it is not as well tested and cannot use
npm lock files.

For code, any editor with syntax-highlighting is acceptable, although Atom has
many packages available to assist with coding in general and with react-native
in particular.
